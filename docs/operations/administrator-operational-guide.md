# OceanViewFlats - Administrator Operational & Breaking Changes Guide
**Target Audience**: Application Administrators, Systems Engineers, Operations & Support Staff  
**Architecture Version**: Clean Architecture, ADR 0001/0004 Gating, & ADR 0005 Admin Subdomain Isolation (Issues #9, #10, #11, #74, #79)  
**Date**: September 2026  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Recent architectural refactorings have transitioned the OceanViewFlats platform from loosely coupled, client-authoritative scripts into a domain-driven, server-authoritative architecture with isolated administrative tooling:
1. **Statutory Hospitality & Security Compliance ([ADR 0001](../adr/0001-mandatory-registry-before-access.md))**: Complete withholding of door keypad PINs and Wi-Fi credentials until the primary guest submits the official Colombian Guest Registry.
2. **Elimination of Plaintext Credentials**: Complete eradication of sensitive access credentials from URL GET query parameters, browser histories, and pre-rendered static artifacts.
3. **Server-Authoritative Pricing ([ADR 0004](../adr/0004-authoritative-quote-engine-and-itemized-pricing.md))**: Centralizing night-by-night seasonal pricing, cleaning fees, and lobby fees within an authoritative backend quote engine to eliminate client-side pricing drift.
4. **Decoupled Fulfillment Infrastructure**: Isolating email rendering, mail delivery, and Google Spreadsheet webhooks behind domain interfaces (Ports & Adapters) to ensure atomic database state and zero transactional crashes.
5. **Subdomain-Isolated Administration ([ADR 0005](../adr/0005-admin-interface-architecture-and-subdomain-isolation.md))**: Centralizing property management system (PMS) workflows on an isolated subdomain (`admin.oceanviewflats.com`) using cPanel Pattern A topology, keeping application controllers, shared domain models, Composer dependencies, and CLI migration tools strictly outside the public web root.

## 2. Summary of Breaking Changes & Architectural Enhancements

| Area | Prior Behavior (Legacy) | New Behavior (Current) | Operational Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin Interface & Subdomain** | No dedicated admin portal; direct database manipulation required. | Standalone administrative portal hosted at `admin.oceanviewflats.com` (DocumentRoot: `/home/<user>/admin/public`). | Operations staff manage bookings, calendar blocks, and rate overrides via a hardened, server-rendered HTMX interface. |
| **Guest Guide URLs** | `/guide/?doorCode=1606#&wifi=...` displayed credentials directly from query string. | Query parameters `doorCode`, `door_code`, and `wifi` are **completely ignored**. The guide only accepts `?code={reservation_uid}` and queries `/api/guide-access.php`. | **CRITICAL**: Any manual message or CRM template sending `doorCode` in links will leave the guest with locked credentials (`••••••`). Templates must be updated. |
| **Confirmation Emails** | Direct booking receipts included door PINs and Wi-Fi passwords immediately upon payment. | Confirmation emails **strictly omit** door codes, Wi-Fi passwords, and direct guide URLs. They contain an invitation button to `/registry/?code=...`. | Guests must complete the registration form before they receive access credentials. Support staff must not manually hand out PINs without registry submission. |
| **Database Schema** | `reservations` table lacked registration status and door code tracking; no admin tables. | `reservations` tracks `registry_completed` and dynamic `door_code`; `guest_registries` audits guest IDs; `admin_users` and `admin_audit_logs` manage authenticated staff. | **MANDATORY**: Administrator must run `php scripts/migrate.php` on production. Omission causes SQL fatal errors on registry, access, and admin endpoints. |
| **Credential Storage & Dynamic PINs** | Door codes were static and identical across all guests. | Lock requires a **7-digit PIN followed by '#'** (`0XXXXXX#`), dynamically generated per guest from the primary guest's Government ID/Passport (with phone fallback) upon Guest Registry completion. The code is saved to `reservations.door_code` and emailed to `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` so staff can program the physical lock in its companion app. | Staff must program the generated 7-digit PIN into the external smart-lock platform upon receiving the guest registry report. If needed, admins can manually override `door_code` via the admin portal or directly in MySQL. |
| **Direct Quote Calculation** | Client JavaScript calculated subtotals from static JSON; backend verified superficial totals. | Backend `SeasonalPricer` authoritatively computes night-by-night rates, minimum stays, and fees from `public/data/prices.csv`. Client totals are ignored. | Any change in property nightly pricing or minimum-stay tiers must be made in `public/data/prices.csv`. |
| **Inbound Channel Sync (iCal)** | No automated OTA calendar sync; manual date blocking required. | Automated background synchronization of external Airbnb iCal feeds via CLI cron (`scripts/sync-channels.php`) caching blocked dates to ephemeral JSON files (`avail_{property}.json`) without database mutations ([ADR 0002](../adr/0002-inbound-channel-sync-caching.md)). | Configure cPanel 15-minute cron job. Operations staff can trigger manual synchronization or bypass cooldown using CLI flags (`--force`, `--property`). |

## 3. cPanel Subdomain Configuration (Pattern A Topology)

### 3.1 Webroot Isolation & Pattern A Overview

The administrative subsystem is deployed using **cPanel Pattern A**, which decouples the admin front-controller entry point from sensitive source code, vendor libraries, and database tools:

```text
/home/<cpanel_user>/
├── public_html/                 <-- DocumentRoot for oceanviewflats.com (Public SSG)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── js/
│   ├── css/
│   └── api/                     <-- Public REST APIs (calls /home/<user>/vendor/autoload.php)
│       ├── config.php
│       └── ...
├── admin/
│   ├── public/                  <-- DocumentRoot for admin.oceanviewflats.com (Pattern A)
│   │   ├── index.php            <-- Administrative Front-Controller
│   │   └── .htaccess            <-- URL Rewriting & HTTP Security Headers
│   ├── src/                     <-- Admin Application Controllers, Auth, & Http Handlers
│   └── templates/               <-- Server-rendered PHP Templates (HTMX Components)
├── src/
│   └── Domain/                  <-- Shared Domain Models (QuoteEngine, Ledger, DoorCode, Reservation)
├── vendor/                      <-- Production Composer Autoloader & Dependencies
└── scripts/                     <-- CLI Utilities (migrate.php, create-admin-user.php, sync-channels.php)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why Pattern A?**
> In standard cPanel setups (Pattern B), subdomains are often created inside `public_html/admin`. If an Apache `.htaccess` rule fails or mod_rewrite is misconfigured, raw PHP files in nested folders can become readable over HTTP.
> **Pattern A** places the subdomain DocumentRoot at `/home/<user>/admin/public`. The application logic (`admin/src/`), templates (`admin/templates/`), domain core (`src/Domain/`), Composer dependencies (`vendor/`), and migration scripts (`scripts/`) reside entirely **outside any web-accessible root**. They are physically impossible to access or execute via HTTP requests.

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Subdomain Creation in cPanel

Follow these steps to establish the isolated subdomain in cPanel:

1. **Log in to cPanel** using your administrative credentials.
2. Navigate to the **Domains** section and click **Domains** (or **Subdomains**, depending on your cPanel theme).
3. Click the **Create A New Domain** button.
4. In the **Domain** input field, enter:
   ```text
   admin.oceanviewflats.com
   ```
5. **Deselect / Uncheck** the checkbox labeled:
   > *"Share document root (/home/username/public_html) with 'domain.com'"*
6. In the **Document Root (file system location)** input field, specify:
   ```text
   admin/public
   ```
   *(cPanel automatically prefixes this with your home directory, resolving to `/home/<username>/admin/public`)*.
7. Click **Submit**.

### 3.3 AutoSSL / Let's Encrypt Activation

All administrative traffic requires end-to-end TLS encryption (HTTPS) with HTTP-only, secure session cookies:

1. In cPanel, navigate to the **Security** section and click **SSL/TLS Status**.
2. Locate `admin.oceanviewflats.com` in the domain certificate list.
3. If the certificate is not yet issued or shows an expired badge, check the checkbox next to `admin.oceanviewflats.com`.
4. Click the **Run AutoSSL** button at the top of the interface.
5. cPanel will trigger an automated HTTP-01 challenge via Let's Encrypt or Sectigo cPanel AutoSSL.
6. Refresh the page after 1–2 minutes. Verify that a **green lock icon** appears next to `admin.oceanviewflats.com`.
7. Return to **Domains** -> **Domains**, locate `admin.oceanviewflats.com`, and ensure the **Force HTTPS Redirect** toggle switch is enabled (**ON**).

## 4. CI/CD Deployment & Secrets Configuration

### 4.1 Dual-Pipeline Deployment Architecture

The repository utilizes two decoupled GitHub Actions deployment workflows to maintain separation of concerns:

1. **Public Static Site Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**:
   - **Trigger**: Pushes to `main`.
   - **Build**: Compiles the React/TypeScript Static Site Generator into static HTML (`dist/`).
   - **Target**: Deploys `./dist/.` to `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` (`/home/<user>/public_html/`) via SFTP.
   - **Purpose**: Fast marketing site updates without backend overhead.
2. **Admin & Domain/Vendor Pipeline (`.github/workflows/admin-deploy.yml`)**:
   - **Trigger**: Pushes to `main` modifying `admin/**`, `src/Domain/**`, `scripts/**`, `composer.json`, or `composer.lock`.
   - **Build**: Sets up PHP 8.3, installs production Composer dependencies with `composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader`, and injects environment variables into `admin/public/.htaccess`.
   - **Payload**: Packages `admin/`, `src/Domain/`, `vendor/`, and `scripts/` (excluding tests, PHPUnit configs, and PHPStan metadata).
   - **Target**: Deploys the staged payload to `REMOTE_DESTINATION` (`/home/<user>/`) via SFTP.
   - **Purpose**: Independent, zero-downtime releases for backend logic and administrative tools.

### 4.2 GitHub Actions Secrets Catalog

## 5. Database Migration & Schema Management

### 5.1 Resilient Environment Discovery (`EnvLoader`)
On cPanel shared hosting, Apache environment variables (`SetEnv`) injected during CI/CD are loaded only within web request contexts, leaving standalone CLI shells and cron runners without database credentials.

To prevent MySQL `1045 Access denied` errors, all CLI utilities (`scripts/migrate.php`, `scripts/create-admin-user.php`) and web setup endpoints utilize `OceanViewFlats\Domain\Support\EnvLoader`. `EnvLoader` automatically scans and parses `admin/public/.htaccess`, `public_html/.htaccess`, and local `.env` files, making database credentials immediately available across CLI, cron, and web runners without overwriting system environment variables.

### 5.2 Migration Execution Methods

Database structural changes must **never** occur inline within guest-facing HTTP request lifecycles. All schema migrations are centralized in `OceanViewFlats\Domain\Database\MigrationRunner` and can be executed via four alternative methods:

#### Method A: Via SSH
Connect to your cPanel host using the dedicated SFTP/SSH port (`2223`):
```bash
ssh -p 2223 cpaneluser@cpanel.oceanviewflats.com
cd /home/<user>
php scripts/migrate.php
```

#### Method B: Via cPanel Terminal
1. Log in to cPanel.
2. Under the **Advanced** section, click **Terminal**.
3. Accept the terminal warning if opening for the first time.
4. Execute:
   ```bash
   php scripts/migrate.php
   ```

#### Method C: Via Scheduled cPanel Cron Job (Zero-SSH CLI Alternative)
If your cPanel hosting tier does not grant interactive SSH or Terminal access, you can run migrations via a one-off cPanel Cron Job:
1. Log in to cPanel and navigate to **Advanced** -> **Cron Jobs**.
2. Under **Add New Cron Job**, select **Once Per Minute** (`* * * * *`).
3. In the **Command** field, enter:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/php /home/<cpanel_user>/scripts/migrate.php > /home/<cpanel_user>/migration.log 2>&1
   ```
4. Click **Add New Cron Job**.
5. Wait 1–2 minutes, then open cPanel **File Manager** and inspect `/home/<cpanel_user>/migration.log` to verify completion.
6. **Immediately delete the cron job** in cPanel once the migration succeeds.

#### Method D: Via Secure Web Setup Utility (`setup.php`)
If command-line or cron execution is entirely unavailable, use the web-based setup utility hosted on the admin subdomain:
1. Navigate to the setup endpoint in your browser with your pre-shared secret token:
   ```text
   https://admin.oceanviewflats.com/setup.php?token=YOUR_PRE_SHARED_SECRET
   ```
   *(Acceptable secrets include your `OVF_SETUP_TOKEN`, `OVF_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`, or `DB_PASS`)*.
2. In the **1. Database Migrations** card, click **Run Database Migrations**.
3. The interface will execute `MigrationRunner` and display real-time verification for all eight database tables.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Defense-in-Depth Auto-Lockout**:
> As soon as an administrator account exists in `admin_users`, `setup.php` permanently disables itself and returns `HTTP 403 Forbidden` (`Setup is locked`). This prevents unauthorized migration triggering or credential overrides after initial provisioning.

#### Expected Migration Output:
```text
=== OceanViewFlats Database Migration Running ===
Connecting to MySQL server on 127.0.0.1 (database: cpaneluser_oceanviewflats_db)...
Connected successfully.
Running schema migrations...
Database `cpaneluser_oceanviewflats_db` selected/created.
Table `reservations` verified/created.
Table `payment_idempotency` verified/created.
Table `guest_registries` verified/created.
Table `admin_users` verified/created.
Table `admin_audit_logs` verified/created.
Table `calendar_blocks` verified/created.
Table `property_rates` verified/created.
Table `reservation_refunds` verified/created.
=== Database Migrations Completed Successfully! ===
```

### 5.3 Schema Elements Managed by `MigrationRunner`

1. **`reservations` Table**:
   - `registry_completed`: `TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (Blocks guide access until Colombian registry submission).
   - `registry_completed_at`: `DATETIME DEFAULT NULL` (Timestamp of legal registry receipt).
   - `door_code`: `VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT NULL` (Dynamically generated 7-digit PIN + '#').
   - `refunded_amount`: `DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00` (Refund tracking).
   - `source`: `VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'web'` (Tracks origin: direct, airbnb, manual).
2. **`guest_registries` Table**:
   - Audits complete legal guest submissions (names, ID types, document numbers, ages, vehicle plates, vehicle model, IP address, timestamp).
   - Indexed on `reservation_uid` and `(property_id, check_in, check_out)`.
3. **`payment_idempotency` Table**:
   - Prevents double-charging on checkout retries or duplicate webhook delivery.
4. **`admin_users` Table**:
   - Holds administrative accounts with Argon2id password hashes, role authorizations (`admin`, `superadmin`, `manager`, `viewer`), active status flags, failed login attempt counters, and lockout expiration timestamps.
5. **`admin_audit_logs` Table**:
   - Immutable audit trail recording user ID, action, entity type, entity ID, metadata JSON payload, IP address, user agent, and timestamp.
6. **`calendar_blocks` Table**:
   - Tracks manual reservations and external channel blocks with conflict detection.
7. **`property_rates` Table**:
   - Manages dynamic seasonal rate overrides and cleaning fees.
8. **`reservation_refunds` Table**:
   - Tracks itemized refund disbursements and Mercado Pago refund references.
9. **`condominium_clearances` Table**:
   - Tracks external Condominium Administration Portal (Huésped Manager) clearance synchronization state, submission attempts, error payloads, and assigned Condominium Clearance Numbers (`clearance_number` / `consecutivo`).
   - Indexed on `(reservation_uid, clearance_status)` and `(property_id, check_in, check_out)`.

### 5.4 Emergency SQL (Manual Execution Fallback)

If neither CLI nor web migration runners can be used, run the complete schema script [`scripts/schema.sql`](../../scripts/schema.sql) directly inside cPanel **phpMyAdmin** or MySQL command line.

---

## 6. Administrator User Provisioning & Credential Runbook

Administrator accounts are bootstrapped using either the CLI provisioning utility or the secure web setup interface. Both methods strictly enforce Argon2id password hashing and input validation.

### 6.1 Method 1: Web Provisioning via `setup.php` (Recommended for Initial Setup)

When bootstrapping a fresh environment without SSH access:
1. Open the setup interface:
   ```text
   https://admin.oceanviewflats.com/setup.php?token=YOUR_PRE_SHARED_SECRET
   ```
2. Run database migrations first if not already performed.
3. In the **2. Provision Super Administrator** section, enter:
   - **Full Name**: e.g. `Property Administrator`
   - **Email Address**: e.g. `admin@oceanviewflats.com`
   - **Password**: Minimum 8 characters
4. Click **Create Administrator & Lock Setup**.
5. Upon submission, the account is created via Argon2id, and the setup tool is **permanently locked**. Any subsequent attempt to access `setup.php` will display `Setup Locked (403)` and redirect to the admin login page (`https://admin.oceanviewflats.com/`).

### 6.2 Method 2: CLI Provisioning via `scripts/create-admin-user.php`

For operators with SSH or terminal access, or for ongoing maintenance:

**Security Features**:
- **CLI-Only Enforcement**: Rejects non-CLI invocations with HTTP 403 / exit code 1 to prevent web execution.
- **Argon2id Hashing**: Uses `PASSWORD_ARGON2ID` with high-security memory cost (65,536 KiB), time cost (4 iterations), and thread cost (1 thread).
- **Redaction**: Passwords are never echoed or written to terminal history, stdout, stderr, or system error logs.
- **Idempotent Upsert**: Safely updates existing records without duplicate key errors, resetting failed login locks and updating roles seamlessly.

#### Executing CLI Provisioning:
Connect via cPanel Terminal or SSH and execute:

```bash
php scripts/create-admin-user.php \
  --email="admin@oceanviewflats.com" \
  --name="Property Administrator" \
  --password="YourSecureMasterPassword123!" \
  --role="admin"
```

**Supported Arguments**:
- `--email` (or `-e`): Valid email address used for administrative login.
- `--name` (or `-n`): Full name of the administrator.
- `--password` (or `-p`): Plaintext password (must be at least 8 characters long).
- `--role` (or `-r`): Access role (`admin`, `superadmin`, `manager`, `viewer`; defaults to `admin`).

**Expected Success Output**:
```text
Admin user successfully created: admin@oceanviewflats.com (Role: admin)
```

### 6.3 Password Rotation & Account Reactivation

If an administrator forgets their password, or if an account is locked due to 5 consecutive failed login attempts:

1. Run `scripts/create-admin-user.php` with the administrator's email and new password:
   ```bash
   php scripts/create-admin-user.php \
     --email="admin@oceanviewflats.com" \
     --name="Property Administrator" \
     --password="NewRotatedPassword456!" \
     --role="admin"
   ```
2. **Automated Account Reset**:
   - Re-hashes the new password with Argon2id.
   - Clears `locked_until` (unlocks account immediately).
   - Resets `failed_login_attempts` to `0`.
   - Ensures `is_active = 1`.
3. **Expected Output**:
   ```text
   Admin user successfully updated: admin@oceanviewflats.com (Role: admin)
   ```

---

## 7. Smart Lock PIN Generation & Configuration

### 7.1 Lock Hardware Requirements & Generation Algorithm
OceanViewFlats physical keypad locks require a **7-digit code followed by the '#' key**. Because smart lock credentials change from guest to guest and are programmed into an external companion app (Tuya / TTLock / Yale):
1. **Source**: The Primary Guest's Government ID / Passport number (`doc_num`) entered in the Guest Registry.
2. **Extraction**:
   - All non-digits are stripped (`preg_replace('/\D/', '', $docNum)`).
   - If the ID has no digits (e.g. rare alphabetic document), digits are extracted from the primary guest's phone number.
   - The last 6 digits are extracted and padded with leading `'0'` if fewer than 6 digits are present.
   - The final PIN is prefixed with `'0'` and followed by `'#'` (Format: `0XXXXXX#`).
3. **Delivery to Operations Staff**:
   - The generated PIN is sent immediately in the registry notification email to `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` with a prominent `SMART LOCK ACCESS PIN (ACTION REQUIRED)` banner.
   - The PIN is recorded in `reservations.door_code` and transmitted in the Google Sheets webhook payload.
4. **Manual Admin Override**:
   - If the lock is manually programmed with a custom PIN, the administrator can override it in the admin interface (`admin.oceanviewflats.com`) or directly in the database:
     ```sql
     UPDATE reservations SET door_code = '0987654#' WHERE reservation_uid = 'ovf_...';
     ```

### 7.2 Property Access Credentials & Fallback Environment Variables
| Variable | Description | Default Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PROPERTY_1606_DOOR_CODE` | Keypad PIN fallback for Apartment 1606 (7 digits + #) | `0160600#` |
| `PROPERTY_1606_WIFI_SSID` | Wi-Fi Network Name for 1606 | `APTO1606` |
| `PROPERTY_1606_WIFI_PASSWORD` | Wi-Fi Password for 1606 | `Invitado@1606@HN` |
| `PROPERTY_1707_DOOR_CODE` | Keypad PIN fallback for Apartment 1707 (7 digits + #) | `0170700#` |
| `PROPERTY_1707_WIFI_SSID` | Wi-Fi Network Name for 1707 | `APTO1707` |
| `PROPERTY_1707_WIFI_PASSWORD` | Wi-Fi Password for 1707 | `Invitado@1707@HN` |

> [!TIP]
> **Zero-Downtime Door Code Rotation**: To rotate the fallback door lock code after a security audit, update `PROPERTY_1606_DOOR_CODE` in your GitHub Actions secrets and trigger a redeployment. Do **not** rebuild the frontend (`npm run build`), as the client queries `/api/guide-access.php` at runtime.

### 7.3 Condominium Administration Portal Integration Variables
The automated reception clearance synchronization engine communicates with the external Condominium Administration Portal (Huésped Manager) at Edificio Salguero Sunset using building endpoints and pre-shared check tokens configured per Property:

| Variable | Description | Production Value / Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HUESPED_MANAGER_BASE_URL` | Base remote booking submission endpoint | `https://salguerosunset.huespedmanager.com.co/propietarios/production` |
| `HUESPED_MANAGER_1707_CHECK` | Pre-shared security check token for Property 1707 | `ep92449222` |
| `HUESPED_MANAGER_1606_CHECK` | Pre-shared security check token for Property 1606 | `ep24281580` |

> [!TIP]
> **Check Token Rotation**: If the building administration rotates the check tokens for Property 1707 or 1606, update the corresponding GitHub Actions secret (`HUESPED_MANAGER_1707_CHECK` or `HUESPED_MANAGER_1606_CHECK`) and trigger a deployment. The new tokens are immediately picked up by both the public Guest Registry submission handler and the Admin 1-click clearance retry tool.

## 9. Rate Limiting & Storage Considerations

The API enforces file-based rate limiting via `enforce_rate_limit()` in `public/api/utils.php`:

| Endpoint | Storage File in `sys_get_temp_dir()` | Window | Max Requests |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/api/guide-access.php` | `ovf_guide_access_rate_limits.json` | 10 minutes | 60 requests per IP hash |
| `/api/registry-processor.php` | `ovf_registry_rate_limits.json` | 10 minutes | 10 requests per IP hash |
| `/api/book-request.php` | `ovf_booking_rate_limits.json` | 10 minutes | 10 requests per IP hash |
| `admin.oceanviewflats.com/login` | Database-backed (`admin_users.failed_login_attempts`) | 15 minutes lockout | 5 failed attempts per account |

### Operational Caveats:
1. **File Permissions**: The system temporary folder (`/tmp` or `sys_get_temp_dir()`) must be writable by the web server process user (`www-data`, `nobody`, or `cpaneluser`).
2. **Shared IP / Corporate VPNs**: If an entire travel group or condominium lobby network accesses the guide repeatedly on the same public Wi-Fi, they might exceed the 60 requests / 10 min threshold.
3. **Emergency Reset**: If an IP is accidentally locked out during testing or legitimate guest usage, an administrator can safely flush rate limits without restarting services:
   ```bash
   rm -f /tmp/ovf_*_rate_limits.json
   ```

## 10. Inbound Channel Synchronization (Cron & Troubleshooting)

### 10.1 Architecture & Design Overview (ADR 0002)

OceanViewFlats automatically imports reserved and blocked calendar dates from external Online Travel Agency (OTA) channels (specifically Airbnb iCal feeds) to eliminate double-bookings across direct and third-party booking channels.

Per **[ADR 0002: Inbound Channel Sync Caching Architecture](../adr/0002-inbound-channel-sync-caching.md)**:
1. **Zero Database Mutations**: External OTA sync writes exclusively to ephemeral, local JSON cache files (`public_html/cache/avail_{property}.json`) rather than mutating the MySQL `reservations` or `calendar_blocks` tables.
2. **Ephemeral Disk Cache**: The public booking engine and quote API merge local database reservations with cached external blocks on read.
3. **Structured Health Tracking**: Synchronization results and health states are recorded to `public_html/cache/channel_sync_status.json` with machine-readable timestamps, HTTP status codes, blocked night tallies, and actor attribution.
4. **Pattern A CLI Separation**: Synchronization is executed via the CLI runner `/home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php`, isolated completely outside the public web root.

### 10.2 cPanel Cron Configuration

A 15-minute scheduled cron job must be configured in the cPanel **Cron Jobs** interface to regularly refresh external feeds in the background:

```cron
*/15 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php >> /home/<user>/logs/channel_sync.log 2>&1
```

* **PHP Binary**: `/usr/local/bin/php` (or the server's PHP 8.3 CLI binary path, e.g. `/usr/bin/php`).
* **Script Location**: `/home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php`.
* **Standard Output & Error Log**: `/home/<user>/logs/channel_sync.log`.
* **Execution Interval**: `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes). This interval respects OTA rate limits while keeping calendars updated.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the `/home/<user>/logs` directory exists and has writable permissions (`chmod 0750 /home/<user>/logs`).

### 10.3 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Usage

System administrators and support engineers can manually execute synchronization tasks via SSH or terminal:

```bash
php scripts/sync-channels.php [options]
```

#### Supported Options & Flags:

| Option | Shorthand | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--property=<id>` | `-p <id>` | Synchronize only the specified property ID (e.g. `1606` or `1707`). | Sync all configured properties |
| `--force` | `-f` | Bypass the 60-second cooldown window to force immediate upstream fetch. | `false` (60s cooldown enforced) |
| `--help` | `-h` | Display the CLI help manual and usage examples. | N/A |

#### Common Operational CLI Examples:

```bash
# 1. Run standard synchronization across all properties (respects 60s cooldown):
php scripts/sync-channels.php

# 2. Force immediate refresh across all properties (bypasses cooldown):
php scripts/sync-channels.php --force

# 3. Synchronize only Apartment 1606:
php scripts/sync-channels.php --property=1606

# 4. Force immediate refresh of Apartment 1707:
php scripts/sync-channels.php --property=1707 --force
```

### 10.4 Feed Health Statuses & Operational States

Every synchronization attempt evaluates and records property status in `channel_sync_status.json`:

| Health Status | Description | Cache Handling | CLI Exit Code | Stdout Summary Header |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`healthy`** | Upstream feed fetched successfully (HTTP 200), iCal parsed, and calendar cache written to disk. | Fresh cache written to `avail_{property}.json`. | `0` | `[OK] Channel Sync Completed` |
| **`healthy` (skipped)** | Sync was requested within the 60-second cooldown window. Redundant upstream fetch avoided. | Existing fresh cache preserved untouched. | `0` | `[OK] Channel Sync Completed` |
| **`degraded`** | Upstream fetch failed (e.g. HTTP 500, network timeout, rate limit), but a previously valid cache exists. | **Retains existing cached nights** to safeguard against accidental double-bookings. | `0` | `[WARNING] Channel Sync Completed with warnings` |
| **`error`** | Upstream fetch failed and **no prior cache exists** on disk (or cache is corrupted/unreadable). | No cached blocks available for this property. | `1` | `[ERROR] Channel Sync Completed with errors` |

#### Human-Readable Output Formats:

* **Normal Healthy Completion**:
  ```text
  [OK] Channel Sync Completed (source: cron)
   - Property 1606: healthy (18 blocked nights)
   - Property 1707: healthy (12 blocked nights)
  ```

* **Degraded State (Upstream Failure with Retained Cache)**:
  ```text
  [WARNING] Channel Sync Completed with warnings (source: cron)
   - Property 1606: degraded (18 blocked nights, retained from cache - Upstream fetch failed (HTTP 500))
   - Property 1707: healthy (12 blocked nights)
  ```

* **Fatal Error (No Prior Cache Available)**:
  ```text
  [ERROR] Channel Sync Completed with errors (source: cron)
   - Property 1606: error (0 blocked nights, no cached dates available - Upstream fetch failed (HTTP 404))
  ```

### 10.5 Failure Recovery & Troubleshooting Runbook

#### Symptom 1: Status reports `degraded` for one or more properties.
* **Root Cause**: Upstream OTA provider (Airbnb) returned a non-200 HTTP code, encountered a transient network timeout, or enforced a temporary rate limit.
* **System Safeguard**: OceanViewFlats automatically retains the existing cached blocked dates from the previous successful run. Direct booking guests cannot book dates that were previously confirmed blocked.
* **Resolution**:
  1. Check the sync log:
     ```bash
     tail -n 50 /home/<user>/logs/channel_sync.log
     ```
  2. Inspect the raw status file:
     ```bash
     cat public_html/cache/channel_sync_status.json
     ```
  3. Verify upstream feed URL connectivity directly using curl:
     ```bash
     curl -ILs "https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/..." | head -n 20
     ```
  4. Once connectivity is verified, force a manual sync:
     ```bash
     php scripts/sync-channels.php --force
     ```
  5. When upstream responds with HTTP 200, the system automatically heals and transitions the property back to `healthy`.

#### Symptom 2: Status reports `error`.
* **Root Cause**: The upstream feed failed and there is no prior cache file in `public_html/cache/avail_{property}.json`.
* **Resolution**:
  1. Verify the feed URL configuration in `public_html/api/config.php` under the `ical_feeds` array:
     ```php
     'ical_feeds' => [
         '1606' => 'https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/...ics',
         '1707' => 'https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/...ics',
     ],
     ```
  2. Verify that the cache directory exists and is writable:
     ```bash
     ls -ld public_html/cache
     chmod 0755 public_html/cache
     ```
  3. Re-run with `--force` to test generation:
     ```bash
     php scripts/sync-channels.php --force
     ```

#### Symptom 3: Cron job produces no output or fails to execute.
* **Resolution**:
  1. Verify cron job is registered:
     ```bash
     crontab -l
     ```
  2. Run the script manually using the exact command specified in crontab to inspect direct output:
     ```bash
     /usr/local/bin/php /home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php
     ```
  3. Ensure `scripts/sync-channels.php` has appropriate execute/read permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 0750 /home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php
     ```

## 11. Administrator Troubleshooting & Support Playbook

### Scenario A: Guest states "The door code shows dots (••••••) and the Copy button does nothing."
* **Root Cause 1: Guest has not submitted the guest registry.**
  * *Diagnostic Query*:
    ```sql
    SELECT reservation_uid, guest_name, status, registry_completed 
    FROM reservations WHERE reservation_uid = 'ovf_...';
    ```
  * *Resolution*: If `registry_completed = 0`, remind the guest to click the blue banner button: *"Complete Registration to Unlock"*.
  * *Emergency Override*: If the guest has already submitted their ID details in person, via WhatsApp, or on paper, manually unlock their reservation via the admin portal (`admin.oceanviewflats.com`) or SQL:
    ```sql
    UPDATE reservations 
    SET registry_completed = 1, registry_completed_at = NOW() 
    WHERE reservation_uid = 'ovf_...';
    ```
* **Root Cause 2: Booking is not in `confirmed` status.**
  * *Diagnostic Query*: Check `status` in `reservations`. If it is `pending_payment`, Mercado Pago has not accredited the transaction or cash hold has not been verified.
* **Root Cause 3: The URL does not have the reservation code parameter.**
  * *Diagnostic*: Check if the guest opened `/guide/` instead of `/guide/?code=ovf_...`.
  * *Resolution*: Provide the complete link: `https://oceanviewflats.com/guide/?code=ovf_...&property=1606&lang=es`.

### Scenario B: Guest submitted the registry, but the guide is still locked.
* **Root Cause: The registry was submitted without the reservation identifier.**
  * If a guest navigated directly to `/registry/` rather than following the personalized link from their email, the submission did not include `reservation_code`.
  * *Resolution*:
    1. Inspect the `guest_registries` table to find the submission by guest name or dates:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM guest_registries ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
       ```
    2. Match the reservation and update it:
       ```sql
       UPDATE reservations 
       SET registry_completed = 1, registry_completed_at = NOW() 
       WHERE property_id = '1606' AND check_in = 'YYYY-MM-DD';
       ```

### Scenario C: Error 503 "Database service is temporarily unavailable".
* **Root Cause: MySQL connection failure.**
  * Verify MySQL service status: `systemctl status mysql` (or `mariadb`).
  * Verify database credentials in `public/api/config.php` or environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.
  * Inspect PHP error log: `tail -n 50 /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log` (or `/usr/local/apache/logs/error_log` on cPanel).

### Scenario D: `admin.oceanviewflats.com` returns 404 on clean URLs (`/reservations`, `/rates`, `/login`).
* **Root Cause: Apache mod_rewrite is missing or `.htaccess` in `admin/public` is missing.**
  * Ensure `admin/public/.htaccess` exists with `RewriteEngine On` and `RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]`.
  * Verify cPanel DocumentRoot for `admin.oceanviewflats.com` is set to `admin/public` (not `admin` or `public_html/admin`).

### Scenario E: Admin login displays "Account temporarily locked out".
* **Root Cause: 5 consecutive failed login attempts triggered automated brute-force protection.**
  * Reset and unlock account immediately via CLI:
    ```bash
    php scripts/create-admin-user.php --email="admin@oceanviewflats.com" --name="Admin" --password="NewPassword123!"
    ```

### Scenario F: Dashboard Hub shows "Condominium Clearance Failed" Operational Alert.
* **Root Cause: The Condominium Administration Portal (Huésped Manager) was unreachable, the check token was rejected, or the building portal returned an error during Guest Registry submission.**
  * *Verification*: Click the operational alert in the Dashboard Hub to open the affected reservation detail drawer. Inspect the "Condominium Administration Portal" card to review the attempt count and last error message.
  * *Resolution*:
    1. Confirm that `HUESPED_MANAGER_BASE_URL`, `HUESPED_MANAGER_1707_CHECK`, and `HUESPED_MANAGER_1606_CHECK` are properly configured in `.htaccess` / GitHub Actions secrets.
    2. Click **Retry Clearance Sync** in the reservation detail drawer to trigger an immediate retry.
    3. Alternatively, trigger the retry via the authenticated API:
       ```bash
       curl -X POST "https://admin.oceanviewflats.com/api/admin-condominium-clearance-retry.php" \
         -H "Cookie: ovf_admin_session=..." \
         -H "X-CSRF-Token: ..." \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"reservation_uid":"ovf_..."}'
       ```
    4. Upon successful sync, the status badge turns green (`synced`) and the Condominium Clearance Number is recorded.

## 12. Post-Deployment Verification Checklist

Upon deploying to staging or production, execute this complete verification checklist:

- [ ] **Run Database Migrations**:
  ```bash
  php scripts/migrate.php
  ```
  Confirm output terminates with `=== Database Migrations Completed Successfully! ===`.
- [ ] **Verify Schema & Tables**:
  Execute `SHOW TABLES;` in MySQL to verify `reservations`, `guest_registries`, `payment_idempotency`, `admin_users`, and `admin_audit_logs`.
- [ ] **Provision Initial Super-Admin Account**:
  ```bash
  php scripts/create-admin-user.php --email="admin@oceanviewflats.com" --name="Super Admin" --password="<secure-password>" --role="superadmin"
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Inbound Channel Synchronization CLI**:
  ```bash
  php scripts/sync-channels.php --force
  ```
  Confirm output displays `[OK] Channel Sync Completed` and verify creation of `cache/avail_1606.json`, `cache/avail_1707.json`, and `cache/channel_sync_status.json`.
- [ ] **Configure 15-Minute cPanel Cron Job**:
  Verify cron job registration in cPanel Cron Jobs:
  ```cron
  */15 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /home/<user>/scripts/sync-channels.php >> /home/<user>/logs/channel_sync.log 2>&1
  ```
- [ ] **Verify AutoSSL Status**:
  Visit `https://admin.oceanviewflats.com/login` and verify that the browser presents a valid SSL/TLS certificate without warnings.
- [ ] **Test Admin Front-Controller Clean URLs**:
  Verify navigating to `/login`, `/reservations`, and `/calendar-blocks` resolves through `index.php` without Apache 404 errors.
- [ ] **Test Admin Authentication & Lockout**:
  1. Attempt login with invalid credentials; verify error message.
  2. Log in with valid credentials; verify session cookie `ovf_admin_session` is marked `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Lax`.
- [ ] **Verify Public Gated Access Endpoint (Locked State)**:
  ```bash
  curl -i "https://oceanviewflats.com/api/guide-access.php?code=nonexistent"
  # Expected HTTP 404 with {"success":false,"status":"not_found"}
  ```
- [ ] **Test Registry Gating with Confirmed Booking**:
  1. Locate a test confirmed booking with `registry_completed = 0`.
  2. Curl endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl -i "https://oceanviewflats.com/api/guide-access.php?code=ovf_test_code"
     ```
  3. Verify HTTP 200 with `"status":"registry_required"`, `"verified":false`, and credentials **not present**.
- [ ] **Test Unlocked State**:
  1. Mark test booking completed:
     ```sql
     UPDATE reservations SET registry_completed = 1 WHERE reservation_uid = 'ovf_test_code';
     ```
  2. Curl endpoint again.
  3. Verify HTTP 200 with `"status":"verified"`, `"verified":true`, and `"credentials":{"door_code":"...","wifi_ssid":"...","wifi_password":"..."}`.
- [ ] **Run Automated Test Suites**:
  ```bash
  composer test
  composer admin:test
  composer admin:phpstan
  ```
