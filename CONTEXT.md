## Language

### Accommodations

**Property**:
A specific physical residential apartment managed by OceanViewFlats and offered for short-term rental. Display names in guest-facing interfaces may be localized to match the target market (e.g., "Apartment", "Apartamento"), but Property remains the canonical domain entity.
_Avoid_: Flat, Apartment, Unit, Condo, Listing

**Assigned Parking Space**:
A designated, numbered vehicular bay within Edificio Salguero Sunset deeded and allocated to a specific Property (Bay 87 for Property 1606, Bay 95 for Property 1707).
_Avoid_: Parking Spot, Garage, Car Stall, Driveway

### Stay Duration

**Check-in Date**:
The calendar date on which Guests are authorized to occupy the Property.
_Avoid_: Arrival Date, Start Date

**Check-out Date**:
The calendar date by which all Guests must vacate the Property.
_Avoid_: Departure Date, End Date

**Night**:
The atomic unit of duration and pricing for a Reservation, spanning from afternoon arrival on a date to morning departure the following day. Every Reservation requires a minimum duration of one Night.
_Avoid_: Day, Stay Unit

### Pricing & Currency

**Nightly Rate**:
The base monetary charge for a single Night at a specific Property, dynamically resolved from the seasonal pricing calendar.
_Avoid_: Daily Price, Base Fee, Night Cost

**Quote**:
The calculated, authoritative monetary assessment for a specific Reservation, consisting of the itemized aggregation of each Night's Nightly Rate, plus the mandatory Cleaning Fee and Resort Fee, settling in Settlement Currency (COP).
_Avoid_: Estimate, Bill, Total Price, Cost

**Cleaning Fee**:
A mandatory, flat per-reservation surcharge assessed on every Direct Reservation to cover property preparation and sanitation between Guest stays, established per Property.
_Avoid_: Sanitation Charge, Maid Fee, Turnover Fee

**Resort Fee**:
A mandatory, flat per-reservation administrative and amenities surcharge assessed on every Direct Reservation for building and common-area facilities maintenance.
_Avoid_: Community Fee, Building Fee, Service Surcharge

**Building Registration Fee**:
The mandatory statutory fee of 20,000 COP per person assessed by the Edificio Salguero Sunset condominium administration for guest registration and common area amenities access, payable directly at the front-desk reception upon arrival.
_Avoid_: Resort Fee (reserved strictly for direct booking platform surcharge), Common Area Surcharge, Reception Tax, Porter Fee

**Settlement Currency**:
The authoritative currency for all pricing, quotations, and financial transactions, which is Colombian Pesos (COP). Any foreign currencies presented in interfaces are non-authoritative reference conversions.

### Reservations

**Reservation**:
A time-bounded contractual commitment securing a specific Property for an agreed date range between a Check-in Date and a Check-out Date.
_Avoid_: Booking, Booking Request, Order, Rental

**Direct Reservation**:
A Reservation originated and transacted directly through OceanViewFlats, maintaining full Guest identification, payment records, and access fulfillment workflows.
_Avoid_: Internal Booking, Native Reservation, Website Booking, Direct Booking

**Manual Reservation**:
A Reservation originated directly by an administrator without an external payment gateway (e.g. phone inquiry, external bank wire, or owner occupancy), attributed to an administrative payment source and confirmed immediately to secure calendar dates. Identified by a unique `res-man-*` reservation UID, which functions as an authoritative lookup token across both the Guest Registry and Guest Guide. Distinct from statutory *Guest Registration* / *Guest Registry*, which refers solely to Colombian police registration compliance (SIRE/TRA) and building registration fees.
_Avoid_: Offline Booking, Phone Order, Admin Reservation, Walk-in, Manual Registration

**Manual Reservation Validation & State Preservation Guarantees**:
* **Reactive Submit Lock**: The creation modal submit button is locked (`disabled`, `aria-disabled="true"`, `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`) by default and unlocks only when all client validations pass and dates are confirmed available. Dynamic helper messaging surfaces specific unmet requirements in real time.
* **Asynchronous Ledger Availability Gating**: Changing dates or property triggers an asynchronous quote preview that queries `ReservationLedger::getConflictReasons()`, signaling availability via declarative DOM attributes (`data-available="true|false"`) and `availabilityChecked` custom events.
* **Date Range Auto-Synchronization**: Check-out date is dynamically constrained to a minimum of `check_in + 1 day`, auto-advancing if check-in is selected on or after the current check-out.
* **Source-Dependent Validation Matrix**: Airbnb reservations require an external confirmation code (leaving email/phone optional); direct stays (`bank_transfer`, `cash`, `owner_stay`, `manual_override`) require guest name, valid email, and 7–25 character phone.
* **In-Place HTTP 422 State Preservation**: If submission fails backend validation or encounters a concurrent ledger conflict, the server returns HTTP 422 with itemized conflict reasons, preserving 100% of operator input across all form fields.


**External Reservation**:
A Reservation originating from an external Online Travel Agency (e.g. Airbnb) where financial settlement occurs out-of-band on the external platform, but guest identity, legal Guest Registry completion, and Access Credentials fulfillment are managed within OceanViewFlats. Identified by a unique `res-abnb-*` reservation UID and linked to an External Confirmation Code and optional Channel Block UID.
_Avoid_: External Booking, OTA Hold, Airbnb Order


**Pending Reservation**:
A temporary hold on a Property's calendar created during checkout that preserves dates while awaiting payment confirmation, expiring automatically after either the Standard Hold Window or Voucher Hold Window depending on the selected Payment Method.
_Avoid_: Unpaid Booking, Temporary Hold, Cart

**Standard Hold Window**:
The configurable duration (base standard of 30 minutes, overridable by environment configuration) during which interactive digital checkouts (Card, PSE) hold calendar dates before expiring.

The extended 72-hour duration during which a Pending Reservation holding an unredeemed Cash Voucher reserves calendar dates before expiring automatically.
_Avoid_: Long Hold, Extended Grace Period, Ticket Expiration

A Reservation backed by verified payment that definitively locks the Property's calendar for the reserved dates.
_Avoid_: Paid Booking, Finalized Reservation

_Avoid_: Void Booking, Expired Hold

**Concluded Reservation**:
A Confirmed Reservation whose stay duration has completed past 23:59:59 COT on the Check-out Date. Concluded Reservations permanently invalidate and suppress public Guest Guide credentials and Guest Registry access, redacting all personal guest identity and stay details to prevent data information leaks.

### Channel Synchronization

**Channel Sync**:
The automated or administratively triggered bidirectional exchange of calendar availability between OceanViewFlats and external booking channels using the iCalendar protocol to prevent dual-booking conflicts.
_Avoid_: Calendar Sync, iCal Integration, Availability Mirror

**Channel Block**:
A period of calendar unavailability imported from an external Online Travel Agency (e.g., Airbnb) via calendar sync.

_Avoid_: External Reservation, Airbnb Booking, OTA Booking, Blackout Date

The unique identifier of an iCalendar event imported from an external channel feed, recorded on an External Reservation to link the registered stay with its source Channel Block and display an onboarded status badge in administrative views.

**Maintenance Block**:
A deliberate administrative unavailability hold applied to a Property's calendar for maintenance, repairs, or private host use. Maintenance Blocks do not create Reservation records, Guest identities, or financial transactions, but are projected onto Outbound Feeds to block external channels.
_Avoid_: Admin Block, Blackout Dates, Owner Hold

**Inbound Feed**:
An external calendar subscription periodically fetched by OceanViewFlats to identify and enforce Channel Blocks against direct checkout requests.
_Avoid_: Calendar Import, External Feed, Inbound iCal

**Outbound Feed**:
The dynamic iCalendar stream generated by OceanViewFlats providing external channels with real-time dates blocked by Direct Reservations and Maintenance Blocks. Outbound Feeds strictly exclude External Reservations whose source matches the target channel (e.g. excluding Airbnb reservations from Airbnb outbound feeds) to prevent circular booking loops.
_Avoid_: Calendar Export, ICS Feed, Availability Export

### Guest Onboarding & Fulfillment

**Guest Registry**:
The mandatory record of legal identification, ages, Primary Guest contact email, and vehicle details for all staying Guests required by building administration and regulatory compliance before Property access is granted.
